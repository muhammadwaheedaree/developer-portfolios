# 🌐 Developer Portfolios  

Welcome to the **Developer Portfolios Repository** – where I show off my **Next.js** and **TypeScript** skills in two ways: one with **Custom CSS** and the other with the magic of **Tailwind CSS**. Why? Because why settle for one styling method when you can flex both? 💪

## 📂 Projects  

### 1. **Portfolio with Custom CSS**  
- **Purpose**: Look, no pre-built classes here! Just pure, handcrafted CSS magic.  
- **Live Demo**: [View Portfolio](https://dev-portfolio-roan.vercel.app/)  

### 2. **Portfolio with Tailwind CSS**  
- **Purpose**: Fast, efficient, and oh-so-stylish with Tailwind's utility-first approach.  
- **Live Demo**: [View Portfolio](https://my-portfolio-beryl-tau.vercel.app/)  

> **PSA**: Need more details? Check the project folders, where all the magic happens. 💥

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Framework**: Next.js  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Custom CSS & Tailwind CSS (it’s like choosing between pizza and pasta – both great!)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (because it’s fast and free – who doesn’t love that?)
